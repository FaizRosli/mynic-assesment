assesment
this system will accept user to add note, update, and delete, since it has not well defined in the assesment question, there is no user validation input. therefore user can fill anything in the form before submit.
this system is developed with laravel 5.8 because i do not have node.js installed yet. therefore im unable to use latest laravel 7 version
i have to attach in zip format because im sending as well the vendor folder.
